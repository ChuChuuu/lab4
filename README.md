A.
the identifiers are used for the function is:
000000000040052d T _Z7averageif
00000000004004ed T _Z7averagePdRd


B. what is the output of the following program?

1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8


the size of a,b,c,d are the size of the memory which the varible need
because a,b,c,d are different type , so the size may be different

but the pointer is to store the address of the memory 
and the way to express adress is the same
so pa,pb,pc,pd will have the same size
